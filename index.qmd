## About Me

I turn complex health data into actionable insights that improve patient outcomes and advance therapies. 
With 10+ years of experience in quantitative research, I specialize in patient-centred outcomes research—understanding how diseases and treatments impact patients, caregivers, and healthcare systems. My work bridges clinical research, health economics, and real-world evidence, translating data into strategic decisions that matter for therapy development and population health. I am passionate about leveraging data science to drive innovation in healthcare.
